# Spike
Spike is a 1lb combat robot designed to participate at the competition known 
as the **SCR@M**: https://leatherbacks.notion.site/SCR-M-Allowed-Parts-List-7415e14e8c94436496a05054f4add28d
This event was organized by the combat robotics club **Leathebacks** Robotics UMD: https://www.instagram.com/leatherbacks.umd/

## Type of robot
Spike is a vertical spinner robot with two teeths and guards attached to the front so it can break in half whoever stands in its way. 
It's body structure was made of PLA with about 15% in-fill on average.

## Future improvements 
Change the way the weapon mounts are attached.
Determine a better attack angle for the spinner.
Check zones that can be reduced without pushing the electrical wiring and components inside. 
Try new ideas for fastening.
Design a different geometry for the saw.

## Lessons Learned
Tolerances are crucial to achieve some design requirements. 
Measure every component if available so less corrections are required.
Look for the simple ways to fasten and assembly together components. 
In real there's always fixes on  we can do at the cost of performance (eg: plastic welding)
