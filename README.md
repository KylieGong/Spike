* Navigate to your folder in the command line
* Do the following commands:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'message'
git push
```

`git add .` adds everything that's changed in the folder to the path to be uploaded

`git commit -m 'message'` creates a message for users to know what was changed, in this case, the message is 'message'

`git push` pushes the changes onto github. The github repository should match your local repository after doing this command.
